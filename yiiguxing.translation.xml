      <item value="The underlying implementation of String::replaceAll calls the java.util.regex.Pattern.compile() method each time it is called even if the first argument is not a regular expression. This has a significant performance cost and therefore should be used with care. When String::replaceAll is used, the first argument should be a real regular expression. If it’s not the case, String::replace does exactly the same thing as String::replaceAll without the performance drawback of the regex. This rule raises an issue for each String::replaceAll used with a String as first parameter which doesn’t contains special regex character or pattern." />

      <item value="When @Autowired is used, dependencies need to be resolved when the class is instantiated, which may cause early initialization of beans or lead the context to look in places it shouldn’t to find the bean. To avoid this tricky issue and optimize the way the context loads, dependencies should be requested as late as possible. That means using parameter injection instead of field injection for dependencies that are only used in a single @Bean method." />

If the char value at (index - 1) is in the low-surrogate range, (index - 2) is not negative, and the char value at (index - 2) is in the high-surrogate range, then the supplementary code point value of the surrogate pair is returned. If the char value at index - 1 is an unpaired low-surrogate or a high-surrogate, the surrogate value is returned." />
